    '1': """We start learning about language by looking at the sounds we use when we speak. This area of study is called phonetics. Phonetics is a separate part of linguistics, just like lexicology (the study of words) or grammar (the rules of language).

These different branches of linguistics study language in different ways:

- **Lexicology** focuses on the words in a language, how they started, how they change, their meanings, and how new words are formed.
- **Grammar** explains the rules for changing words and how to put words together into sentences.
- **Phonetics** looks at the sounds of language. Phoneticians study the basic sounds (called phonemes) and their variations (called allophones), how syllables are formed, where stress is placed in words, and how intonation works.

Phoneticians are interested in the sounds made by our speech organs and how those sounds are used in language. We can think of these sounds as the "phonic medium," and the individual sounds as "speech sounds." 

So, phonetics is the study of the phonic medium. It looks at how humans create, send, and understand speech sounds. Phonetics also studies how these sounds are organized into a system and how they vary in different types and styles of spoken language.

Phonetics is a fundamental part of linguistics. You cannot study language theory or practice without considering phonetics. Every study of language needs to pay attention to the sounds that are used to express meaning.""",
    '2':"""Phoneticians study how sounds work in specific languages, focusing on the abstract aspects of speech sounds. The branch that examines the functional aspects of these sounds is called **phonology**. Unlike phonetics, which looks at all possible human sounds, phonology focuses on sound contrasts that change meaning in language.

Phonetics can be divided into several branches:

1. **General Phonetics**: Studies all the sounds humans can produce and how they are used in communication.
2. **Descriptive Phonetics**: Examines the sound system of a specific language, describing its pronunciation and phonetic units.
3. **Historical Phonetics**: Tracks changes in a language's sound system over time.
4. **Comparative Phonetics**: Compares the sound systems of different languages to find similarities and differences.

Phonetics can also be **theoretical** or **practical**:

- **Practical (Normative) Phonetics**: Looks at the physical form of sounds in relation to their meaning.
- **Theoretical Phonetics**: Focuses on how phonetic units function within a language.

Theoretical linguistics aims to build theories about language structure, while applied linguistics uses these theories for practical purposes, such as language teaching.

All branches of phonetics are interconnected and relate to other fields. For example:

- **Acoustic Phonetics** connects to physics and mathematics.
- **Articulatory Phonetics** relates to physiology and anatomy.
- **Historical Phonetics** ties into the history of the people and archaeology.
- **Phonology** connects to communication theory, mathematics, and statistics.
""",
    '3':"""We can separate phonetic research methods into two types: subjective (personal) methods and objective (scientific) methods.

The oldest and simplest method is direct observation. This means watching how our own or other people's speech organs move and change position when saying different sounds. It also involves paying attention to our physical sensations while speaking and comparing them to what we hear.

Objective methods use various tools and instruments, such as palatography, laryngoscopy, photography, X-ray imaging, and electromyography. These methods, along with direct observation, are commonly used in experimental phonetics. Both objective and subjective methods work together and support each other. Today, we can use advanced tools like the articulograph to measure and record how speech is produced.

Acoustic phonetics is closely related to physics. In this area, researchers use tools to measure and analyze how air moves when we speak. This typically involves using a microphone to capture the air movement, converting it into electrical signals, and analyzing these signals based on their frequency and amplitude over time. The sound spectrograph is used to study the different speech sounds, while an intonograph can be used to analyze pitch, which is an important part of intonation.

The acoustic features of speech sounds can be studied not only with sound-analyzing tools but also with speech-synthesizing devices.""",
    '4': """Sound phenomena can be understood through four main aspects:

(a) **Articulatory Aspect**: This involves the movements and positions of speech organs used to produce sounds. The speech organs can be grouped into four categories:
1. **Power Mechanism**: Provides the energy for sound through air pressure, including the diaphragm, lungs, bronchi, and trachea.
2. **Vibration Mechanism**: Consists of the larynx (voice box) and vocal cords, which create sound through their vibrations.
3. **Resonator Mechanism**: Includes the pharynx, mouth, and nasal cavity, which amplify and shape the sound.
4. **Obstruction Mechanism**: Made up of the tongue, lips, teeth, and palate, which create different types of sound blocks.

(b) **Acoustic Aspect**: This focuses on sound waves. The vibrations of the vocal cords produce a basic tone, along with additional tones (overtones and harmonics). The frequency of these vibrations determines the pitch of the voice, while the strength of the vibrations affects the loudness.

(c) **Auditory (Perceptive) Aspect**: This aspect involves both physical and mental processes. Physically, humans can hear sounds between 16 Hz and 20,000 Hz and can detect differences of about 3 Hz. The ear converts sound vibrations into signals for the brain. Mentally, while sounds may seem similar, they are often not identical. Instead of focusing on perfect matches, we analyze phonetic similarities in language.

(d) **Functional Aspect**: This aspect looks at how sounds are used in language. Phonemes, syllables, stress, and intonation are meaningful units that help convey information in words and sentences. Sounds serve various linguistic functions.""",
    '5':"""The phonetic system of a language consists of various phonetic units organized to replace one another within a specific framework. Phonetics is divided into two main parts: 

1. **Segmental Phonetics**: Focuses on individual sounds, known as "segments," which include vowels and consonants.
2. **Suprasegmental Phonetics**: Deals with larger units of connected speech, such as syllables, words, phrases, and sentences.

### Key Components of Phonetics:

1. **Segmental Units**: These are the sounds of speech (vowels and consonants) that create the vocalic and consonantal systems.
  
2. **Suprasegmental Units**: These include syllables, stress patterns, intonation, rhythm, tempo, and pauses.

Phonetics can be defined as a branch of linguistics that studies speech sounds broadly, including both segmental sounds and suprasegmental features.

### Four Components of the Phonetic System:

1. **Phonemic Component**: This is the system of phonemes, which are the basic sound units represented by their allophones (different pronunciations). It has three aspects:
   - Phonemes as separate units.
   - The distribution of allophones.
   - How speech sounds combine in words (e.g., VC, CV, CC, and VV transitions).

2. **Syllabic Structure**: This refers to how words are formed and divided into syllables. It includes:
   - How syllables are created.
   - How syllables are separated in words.

3. **Accentual Structure**: This involves the stress patterns of words when pronounced alone. It has three aspects:
   - The acoustic nature of word stress.
   - The position of stress in two-syllable and multi-syllable words.
   - The different levels of word stress.

4. **Intonational Structure**: This includes the patterns of pitch and tone in sentences.

Together, these four components—phonemic, syllabic, accentual, and intonational—make up the overall pronunciation of a language.""",
    '6':'''Russian phoneticians classify consonants based on several principles:

1. **Degree of Noise**: This principle distinguishes consonants by how much noise they produce. Some phoneticians, like V.A. Vassilyev, emphasize the type of obstruction in the airflow. He divides consonants into two main classes:
   - **Occlusive Consonants**: These are produced with a complete obstruction of airflow.
   - **Constrictive Consonants**: These involve an incomplete obstruction.
   Each of these classes can be further divided into:
   - **Noise Consonants**: These create more noise.
   - **Sonorants**: These are more resonant sounds.

2. **Place of Articulation**: This principle categorizes consonants based on where the airflow is obstructed in the vocal tract. Russian phoneticians provide detailed descriptions of the active parts of the mouth involved in producing these sounds. They divide the tongue into:
   - **Front (tip)**
   - **Middle**
   - **Back**
   There are also subdivisions based on tongue position, such as:
   - **Apical**: tip of the tongue
   - **Dorsal**: back of the tongue
   - **Cacuminal** and **Retroflexed**: specific positions of the tongue relative to the teeth ridge.

   Other scholars may use different terms for these parts, leading to some variation in classification.

3. **Manner of Articulation**: This principle looks at how consonants are produced based on the type of closure in the vocal tract. Russian scholars classify consonants as follows:
   - **Complete Closure**: Produces occlusive (stop or plosive) consonants.
   - **Incomplete Closure**: Produces constrictive consonants.
   - **Combination of Closures**: Produces affricate consonants.
   - **Intermittent Closure**: Produces rolled or trilled consonants.

4. **Position of the Soft Palate**: Consonants are divided into:
   - **Oral Consonants**: Produced when the soft palate is raised.
   - **Nasal Consonants**: Produced when the soft palate is lowered.

5. **Force of Articulation**: This principle distinguishes consonants based on how strongly they are articulated. They can be classified as:
   - **Fortis**: Strong or voiceless consonants.
   - **Lenis**: Weak or voiced consonants.

These classification principles help phoneticians understand and describe the different types of consonants in languages.''',
    '7':'''### 1. Stability of Articulation

British and American phoneticians do not specifically highlight the stability of vowel articulation. For example, P. Roach states that British English (BBC accent) typically has short vowels, long vowels, and diphthongs. In contrast, Russian scholars categorize vowels into three types:

- **Monophthongs**: The tongue remains in a stable position.
- **Diphthongs**: The tongue moves from one position to another.
- **Diphthongoids**: A mix between the two, where the tongue movement is minimal.

Different authors define diphthongs in various ways. A.C. Gimson identifies 20 vocalic phonemes made up of vowels and vowel glides. D. Jones describes diphthongs as single-syllable sounds where the speech organs start in one position and glide to another. In English, vowels like [i:] and [u:] can have a diphthongal glide when they are fully pronounced (as in "be" and "do"), and there is a growing trend towards diphthongization.

### 2. Position of the Tongue

Russian phoneticians categorize vowels based on the horizontal position of the tongue into five classes:

1. Front
2. Front-retracted
3. Central
4. Back
5. Back-advanced

British phoneticians do not recognize the front-retracted and back-advanced categories, classifying both [i:] and [i] as front vowels, and [u:] and [ʊ] as back vowels.

Regarding the vertical position of the tongue, British phoneticians identify three classes of vowels:

- High (or close)
- Mid (or half-open)
- Low (or open)

Russian phoneticians provide a more detailed classification, dividing each of these classes into broad and narrow variations, resulting in six vowel groups.

### Vowel Length and Quantity

Vowel length has been a topic of debate among phoneticians. All sounds, including vowels, have physical duration. In connected speech, the duration of a vowel can be influenced by several factors:

1. The vowel's inherent length
2. The syllable's stress
3. The phonetic context
4. Its position in the rhythmic structure
5. Its position in a tone group
6. Its position in a complete utterance
7. The overall tempo of the speech
8. The style of pronunciation

Phonologists study whether variations in vowel length are meaningful contrasts.

### Tenseness

Another important characteristic is tenseness, which refers to the state of the speech organs during vowel production. Instrumental analysis shows that historically long vowels are typically tense, while historically short vowels are lax.''',


    '8': """Understanding how sounds are produced is not enough to classify them as parts of language. The term "sound" can mean two things. For example, [t] and [d] are different sounds in English, as seen in "ten" vs. "den" and "seat" vs. "seed." However, the [t] in "let us" and the [t] in "let them" are not the same, differing by just one feature, but this difference doesn’t change the meaning. To clarify this, linguists use two terms: phoneme and allophone.

A **phoneme** is the smallest unit in language that can change meaning, like distinguishing between "bath" and "path." Phonemes help differentiate words and phrases, like "He was heard badly" vs. "He was hurt badly," showing their **distinctive function**.

Phonemes are also **material and real**; they appear as speech sounds (allophones) and form the basis of morphemes. This is called the **constitutive function**.

Additionally, phonemes help with **recognition**. Using the correct sounds makes it easier to understand speech. In summary, phonemes are both concrete and abstract units in language.""",
    '9': """The goal of phonological analysis is to identify which sound differences are important for meaning (phonemic) and which are not (non-phonemic). It also aims to list the phonemes in a language. 

Phonology uses specific methods to study sounds. One method is the semantic method, which can be used for both unknown languages and those that have been studied. This method is based on the idea that phonemes can change the meaning of words when they are compared. It involves swapping one sound for another to see if the meaning changes while keeping the surrounding sounds the same. This process is called the **commutation test**, which looks for minimal pairs of words. For example, pairs like "pen" [pen] and "Ben" [ben], or "ten" [ten] and "den" [den], help identify phonemes in a language.

A phoneme can only serve its purpose in distinguishing meaning when it is compared with another phoneme in the same position. This comparison is known as a **phonological opposition**. 

N.S. Trubetzkoy classified these oppositions based on how many differences there are in how the sounds are made:

1. **Single opposition**: Two sounds differ by one feature, like [p] and [t] in "pen" and "ten."
2. **Double opposition**: Two sounds differ by two features, like [p] and [d] in "pen" and "den."
3. **Triple opposition**: Two sounds differ by three features, like [p] and [ð] in "pay" and "they."

Some American linguists, especially Zellig Harris, argue that the **distributional method** is the only scientific way to analyze phonemes. They believe the semantic method is unscientific because it considers meaning, which they see as outside of linguistics. 

Using the distributional method, they group sounds based on how they are used by native speakers:

1. **Contrastive distribution**: Different phonemes can appear in the same context.
2. **Complementary distribution**: Allophones (variations of a phoneme) never occur in the same context.
3. **Free variation**: Both sounds exist in the language, but speakers use them inconsistently, like in the examples "калоши" and "галоши."

These three types of distribution help linguists understand how sounds function in a language.""",
    '10': """Let's look at the English sound [d]. It is occlusive, forelingual, apical, alveolar, lenis. You can hear it clearly in words like "door," "darn," and "down." This clear [d] is called the **principal allophone**. 

There are also **subsidiary allophones** of [d] that change slightly depending on the sounds around them. For example:
- In "deal" and "did," it sounds a bit different before front vowels.
- In "bad pain" and "bedtime," it is pronounced without a burst of air.
- In "sudden" and "admit," it has a nasal sound before [n] or [m].
- In "dry," it sounds different before [r].

All these variations of [d] share some common features—they are all soft, blocking sounds made with the tongue. However, native speakers usually don’t notice these differences. They understand that each phoneme, like [d], has important features that make it different from other sounds in the language. This set of important features is called the **invariant of the phoneme**. 

For [d], the invariant features are that it is a soft, blocking sound made with the tongue. If it changes to a different kind of sound, like [z], it can change the meaning of words, such as "breed" to "breeze" or "deal" to "zeal." The features that help distinguish meaning are called **distinctive features**. 

To find these important features, we compare [d] with another sound. If the difference in one feature changes the meaning, that feature is relevant. For example, in "port" and "court," [p] and [k] are both blocking sounds, but [p] is made with the lips, while [k] is made with the tongue.

Features that do not change meaning are called **non-distinctive** or **redundant**. For instance, you can't use the difference between an aspirated [ph] and a non-aspirated [p] to change meaning.

When learning a new language, people often make mistakes in pronunciation. L.V. Shcherba classifies these mistakes as **phonological** (when one allophone is replaced by a different phoneme) or **phonetic** (when one allophone is replaced by another allophone of the same phoneme).""",
